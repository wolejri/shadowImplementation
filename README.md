# shadowImplementation

The purpose of this program is to deliver a shadow scene that includes
            * at least one reflective object
            * a computed ground (e.g., a black and white check board);
            * at least two light sources.
            * at least two shadows (depending on the number of light sources) for each reflective object
            * I have explored the use of OpenGL STENCIL'S BUFFER AND ITS POLYGON OFFSET FUNCIONALITY to implement the scene. In addition to this, I'll be using the stb_image library to render my textured objects.
